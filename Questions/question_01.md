## Basic Questions on node js and its enviourment

- What is Node.js?
  - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.
  - Node.js executes code in the Google V8 engine.

- How does Node.js work?
  - Node.js uses a single-threaded async coding style.
  - JavaScript is single-threaded, but Node.js uses the libuv library (written in C++) to handle async operations.
  - libuv manages tasks like file system operations, network requests, timers, and more.

- What is the Event Loop in Node.js?
  - Node.js code executes in a single thread in sync order, but async tasks are delegated to libuv.
  - After the sync code finishes and the call stack is empty, the event loop takes over.
  - The event loop fetches tasks from different queues (timers, I/O, check, close callbacks, microtasks) and pushes them into the call stack.
  - In short, the event loop coordinates async calls in the global execution context.

- What is npm and yarn and their difference?
  - npm (Node Package Manager) and yarn are package managers for JavaScript.
  - Both are used to install, manage, and update project dependencies.
  - Differences:
    - Yarn was designed to be faster and more secure than older versions of npm (npm has improved a lot since v7+).
    - npm installs dependencies sequentially, while yarn installs them in parallel, which makes it faster in many cases.
    - Yarn generates a yarn.lock file, while npm generates a package-lock.json file to lock dependency versions.

- What is nvm?
  - NVM (Node Version Manager) allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single system.
  - You can easily switch between versions depending on project requirements.

- What is package.json?
  - package.json is the main configuration file of a Node.js project.
  - It stores metadata about the project (name, version, scripts) and keeps track of dependencies and their version ranges.

- What is package-lock.json?
  - package-lock.json is automatically generated by npm.
  - It records the exact versions of all installed dependencies (including nested/internal dependencies).
  - This ensures that everyone working on the project installs the same dependency versions, making builds reproducible.

- What is npx and how is it different from npm?
  - npm is mainly used to install project dependencies and manage them via package.json.
  - npx is a tool (comes with npm 5.2+) that is used to execute packages directly without permanently installing them.
  - Difference:
    - With npm, you usually install a package first (npm install some-package) and then run it.
    - With npx, you can run a package directly (npx some-package) without adding it to your dependencies.
    - This is useful for running CLI tools (like npx create-react-app) without polluting your project with extra installs.

- What is npm init?
  - npm init is usually the first command when starting a new Node.js/JavaScript project.
  - It creates a package.json file, which keeps project metadata such as:
    - project name and version
    - description
    - author
    - license
    - keywords
    - repository (e.g., GitHub URL)
    - scripts (like npm run test, npm run dev, npm run build)
    - dependencies and their version ranges
    - npm init -y can be used to skip questions and generate a default package.json instantly.

- When we pull a repo from git and run npm install, how do dependencies get installed — from package.json or package-lock.json?
  - package.json defines the list of dependencies and their version ranges (for example: "express": "^4.18.0").
  - package-lock.json locks the exact version of each dependency (and sub-dependency) that was installed previously in that project.
  - When you run npm install:
    - If package-lock.json is present → npm installs the exact versions listed in it (to ensure consistency across all environments).
    - If only package.json is present → npm resolves dependencies based on the version ranges, which may install slightly newer versions.
    - That’s why package-lock.json should always be committed to git — so all developers and CI/CD pipelines install the same versions.

- What is npm ci and how is it different from npm install?
  - npm ci (Continuous Integration) is used to install dependencies in a clean and reproducible way.
  - It is faster and more reliable for automated environments like CI/CD pipelines.
  - How it works:
    - Deletes the existing node_modules folder.
    - Installs dependencies exactly as specified in package-lock.json.
    - Fails if package-lock.json and package.json are out of sync.
  - Difference from npm install:
    - npm install → installs dependencies, updates package-lock.json if needed.
    - npm ci → installs strictly from package-lock.json (no updates, no version resolution).

- Major difference between yarn.lock and package.lock ?
  - Package.lock.json file format in json while yarn.lock in custom key : value.

- How is Node.js different from JavaScript running in the browser?
  - Async handling:
    - Browser: async code is handled by browser APIs (like setTimeout, DOM events, fetch).
    - Node.js: async code is handled by libuv, which manages the event loop and thread pool.
  - Global object (this):
    - Browser: this refers to the window object.
    - Node.js: this at the top level refers to {} (empty object in modules).
  - Microtasks:
    - Browser: Promises and MutationObserver callbacks are microtasks.
    - Node.js: process.nextTick and Promises are microtasks.
  - System access:
    - Browser: no direct access to file system, network (other than HTTP), or CPU information.
    - Node.js: has built-in modules like fs, os, path, http, crypto for server-side operations.
  - Modules:
    - Browser: ES Modules (import/export) are supported, but CommonJS (require) is not.
    - Node.js: supports CommonJS (require) by default and ES Modules optionally.
  - Execution environment:
    - Browser: code runs in a sandboxed environment, limited by security policies.
    - Node.js: code runs on the server, with full access to the system and network.
  - DOM:
    - Browser: full access to DOM and BOM (document, window, location, navigator).
    - Node.js: no DOM or BOM by default; DOM-like behavior requires external libraries.
  - Event loop phases:
    - Browser: event loop is simpler (tasks, microtasks).
    - Node.js: event loop has multiple phases (timers, pending callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, close callbacks).
  - Package management:
    - Browser: no built-in package manager dependencies are handled via script tags or bundlers.
    - Node.js: uses npm/yarn/pnpm for managing dependencies and modules.

- What is Semantic Versioning (SemVer)?
  - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - ^4.18.8 -> accept 4.x.x
  - ~4.18.6 -> accept 4.18.x

- What is a module, and what are major module systems in JavaScript?
  - Module → A file containing reusable code that can be shared across multiple files.
  - In modern JavaScript, there are mainly two module systems:
    - CJS (CommonJS) → Default module system in Node.js.
    - ESM (ECMAScript Modules) → Standardized modern module system
  - Difference between CJS and ESM:
    - Syntax:
      - CJS → require() and module.exports
      - ESM → import and export
    - Loading behavior:
      - CJS → Synchronous (require() blocks execution until module is loaded)
      - ESM → Asynchronous (top-level import is resolved before script executes)
    - Dynamic import:
      - CJS → require() is always synchronous, cannot use dynamic import() at top-level
      - ESM → Supports dynamic import() at runtime for conditional or lazy loading.

- Node.js Built-in Modules
  - Node.js has many built-in modules that do not require installation:
    - fs → File system
    - path → Path operations
    - http → HTTP server
    - os → OS info
    - crypto → Encryption/Hashing

- What are global objects in Node.js?
  - Global objects are available everywhere in a Node.js application without importing.
  - Similar to window in browsers, but Node.js has its own set of globals.
  - global
  - process
  - console
  - Buffer
  - setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate
  - dirname
  - filename
  - module
  - export
  - require
  - Note :- global not available in EMS and **dirname and **filename also not available.
